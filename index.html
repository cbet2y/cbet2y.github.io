        <div class="modal-body pmodal-body">
            <p><p>I'm Kiwi, despite having left New Zealand over a decade ago and only visiting once since then. I was born in Auckland, New Zealand. I don't have too many memories of the seven or so years I lived in New Zealand, but I distinctly recall being lost in a large primary school. I told a teacher that I was from room 'one-one.' She thought I was from room one, where the big sixth graders were. I was actually from room eleven, but the teacher didn't understand.</p>
<p>My grandparents' backyard had feijoa fruits. I missed and still miss those the most after leaving New Zealand for Australia. For the first few months of living in Melbourne, Australia, we lived in a small hotel where I was on holiday for what felt like forever. Then, just before I started school, we moved to an apartment, where I befriended the manager's son, who was a year older than me and went to the same school. We took the tram to school together and got access to the pool after hours. It was a carefree time.</p>
<p>Halfway through my second year at Melbourne Grammar School, where we wore suits everyday, I left for California, America. I quickly settled into a public American middle school, where we recited the Pledge of Allegiance every day, but a sliver of my accent still lingers. For the first time, I attended a single school, Woodside Priory School, for four years. I now enjoy my time at Claremont McKenna College, where I study Economics and Computer Science.</p></p>

        <div class="modal-body pmodal-body">
            <p><p>My Chinese name is Chen Tian Lang. It literally translates to Sky Wave Chen. When I was younger, I thought Sky Wave meant the clouds in the sky. My dad's Chinese name was Cloud Chen, after all. However, when I was completing an assignment for weekend Chinese school, I asked my mother the meaning behind my Chinese name. She told me about a Chinese phrase, Lang Ji Tian Ya, which means, roughly, to wander the world. My parents named me that because they had just left China for the first time and hoped I would get the opportunity to travel and discover more of this world.</p>
<p>They fulfilled their own wish for me. I have been privileged enough to visit numerous countries because my parents took me on business trips or vacations. Some of my favorite places include Lisbon, Portugal; Edinburgh, UK; and South Carolina, USA. I tend to like peaceful areas with cool architecture or history. In the future, I hope to visit many more of those and other types of cities, using work as an excuse to travel.</p></p>

            <p><p>One of the favorite things I do when I travel is enjoy the local cuisine. I'm not a picky or fancy eater, so I love trying food that is homely and unique to a particular culture. Growing up in New Zealand, I was fueled by British food. In America, there is a stereotype that British food is the worst, but I still miss the sausage rolls and savory pies.
<p>Along the same theme, Indian food tends to be spicy and always warms me up. I also get the same feeling from Korean stews and Dukbokki. Other than those more traditional Korean dishes, I also enjoy Korean fried chicken and Korean barbecue. After moving to Southern California for college, I found friends who enjoyed the same foods and got more opportunities to enjoy Indian and Korean cuisine.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="modal-body pmodal-body">
            <p>From a young age, I loved reading novels. In middle school, the <i>Harry Potter</i> series and the <i>Ranger's Apprentice</i> series were my favorites, and I could reread them numerous time without getting bored. For the early part of high school, I did not read as much outside of school, but I discovered really interesting biographies in the later part of high school. I started with <i>The Snowball</i> about Warren Buffett and <i>Steve Jobs</i>, and moved on to <i>Titan</i> about John D. Rockefeller.
<p>Ever since I went on a middle school class trip to an architect's studio, I have been interested in how houses are designed. During the trip, we each designed a house the area of the surface of a large door. It was an interesting activity that forced us to use a small area effectively. Now, I often read the Real Estate section of the Wall Street Journal to see how developers or architects change their styles depending on the market.</p>

            <p><p>Growing up, I have always been a math and science guy. I enjoyed quantitative problems, because they made logical sense, compared to the assignments from other classes. In high school, I took AP Economics and fell in love with learning about how the economy works. I was fascinated that despite a lot of economic logic, the economy can still be unpredictable. In university, I continued my interests by majoring in Economics and Computer Science. These interests also fuel my exploration of a career in trading (especially foreign
 exchange trading). </p>

        </div>
        <div class="modal-body pmodal-body">
            <p><p>Four of my friends and I embarked on a project to find and test a method for translating SAS code into Python. This was interesting because it helped us understand programming languages more and also because older companies today use SAS but want to translate it to the more modern Python.</p>
<p>We discovered Antlr, which is a parsing tool that creates trees from strings of code. To use Antlr, we simply had to write a dictionary for Antlr to use. Therefore, we tested translating a for loop from Python to SAS by writing "expression" definitions for each part of the loop and letting Antlr create our tree.</p>
