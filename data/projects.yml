    My friends and I tested a method of translating SAS to Python
  title: Code Translation - SAS to Python
  description: >
    <p>Four of my friends and I embarked on a project to find and test a method
    for translating SAS code into Python. This was interesting because it helped
    us understand programming languages more and also because older companies
    today use SAS but want to translate it to the more modern Python.</p>

    <p>We discovered Antlr, which is a parsing tool that creates trees from
    strings of code. To use Antlr, we simply had to write a dictionary for Antlr
    to use. Therefore, we tested translating a for loop from Python to SAS by
    writing "expression" definitions for each part of the loop and letting Antlr
    create our tree.</p>

    Guitwise is an online forum for musicians to share their learning and share
    practicing techniques. This was a final project for a web development
    bootcamp. I worked with Mark K. and Filipe A. to use Rails to create the
    web application.
