  longtitle:
    I have lived in New Zealand, Australia, and the United States of America
  description:
    <p>I'm Kiwi, despite having left New Zealand over a decade ago and only
    visiting once since then. I was born in Auckland, New Zealand. I don't have
    too many memories of the seven or so years I lived in New Zealand, but I
    distinctly recall being lost in a large primary school. I told a teacher
    that I was from room 'one-one.' She thought I was from room one, where the
    big sixth graders were. I was actually from room eleven, but the teacher
    didn't understand.</p>

    <p>My grandparents' backyard had feijoa fruits. I missed and still miss those
    the most after leaving New Zealand for Australia. For the first few months
    of living in Melbourne, Australia, we lived in a small hotel where I was on
    holiday for what felt like forever. Then, just before I started school, we
    moved to an apartment, where I befriended the manager's son, who was a year
    older than me and went to the same school. We took the tram to school
    together and got access to the pool after hours. It was a carefree time.</p>

    <p>Halfway through my second year at Melbourne Grammar School, where we wore
    suits everyday, I left for California, America. I quickly settled into a
    public American middle school, where we recited the Pledge of Allegiance
    every day, but a sliver of my accent still lingers. For the first time, I
    attended a single school, Woodside Priory School, for four years. I now
    enjoy my time at Claremont McKenna College, where I study Economics and
    Computer Science.</p>

  longtitle: My Chinese name literally translates to "Sky Wave"
  title: Sky Wave
  description:
    <p>My Chinese name is Chen Tian Lang. It literally translates to Sky Wave Chen.
    When I was younger, I thought Sky Wave meant the clouds in the sky. My dad's
    Chinese name was Cloud Chen, after all. However, when I was completing an
    assignment for weekend Chinese school, I asked my mother the meaning behind
    my Chinese name. She told me about a Chinese phrase, Lang Ji Tian Ya, which
    means, roughly, to wander the world. My parents named me that because they
    had just left China for the first time and hoped I would get the opportunity
    to travel and discover more of this world.</p>

    <p>They fulfilled their own wish for me. I have been privileged enough to
    visit numerous countries because my parents took me on business trips or
    vacations. Some of my favorite places include Lisbon, Portugal; Edinburgh,
    UK; and South Carolina, USA. I tend to like peaceful areas with cool
    architecture or history. In the future, I hope to visit many more of those
    and other types of cities, using work as an excuse to travel.</p>

  longtitle: Korean, British, and Indian foods are some of my favorites
  title: Favorite Cuisines
  description: >
    <p>One of the favorite things I do when I travel is enjoy the local cuisine.
    I'm not a picky or fancy eater, so I love trying food that is homely and
    unique to a particular culture. Growing up in New Zealand, I was fueled by
    British food. In America, there is a stereotype that British food is the
    worst, but I still miss the sausage rolls and savory pies.

    <p>Along the same theme, Indian food tends to be spicy and always warms me
    up. I also get the same feeling from Korean stews and Dukbokki. Other than
    those more traditional Korean dishes, I also enjoy Korean fried chicken and
    Korean barbecue. After moving to Southern California for college, I found
    friends who enjoyed the same foods and got more opportunities to enjoy
    Indian and Korean cuisine.</p>

  longtitle: I enjoy reading biographies and looking at architecture
  title: Reading and Architecture
  description: >
    From a young age, I loved reading novels. In middle school, the <i>Harry
    Potter</i> series and the <i>Ranger's Apprentice</i> series were my
    favorites, and I could reread them numerous time without getting bored.
    For the early part of high school, I did not read as much outside of school,
    but I discovered really interesting biographies in the later part of high
    school. I started with <i>The Snowball</i> about Warren Buffett and <i>Steve
    Jobs</i>, and moved on to <i>Titan</i> about John D. Rockefeller.

    <p>Ever since I went on a middle school class trip to an architect's studio,
    I have been interested in how houses are designed. During the trip, we each
    designed a house the area of the surface of a large door. It was an
    interesting activity that forced us to use a small area effectively. Now,
    I often read the Real Estate section of the Wall Street Journal to see how
    developers or architects change their styles depending on the market.</p>

  longtitle: Website was made using Ruby's Middleman and GitHub Pages
  title: About This Website
  description: >
    <p>I decided to make a personal website when I started doing more coding or
    research projects that were not associated with a workplace or organization.
    This website will record a high level version of everything I do, including
    general interests and brief descriptions on my jobs and projects. To find
    out more about what I do, either contact me or check out my
    <a href="https://github.com/richychn" target="_blank">GitHub</a> or
    <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/richychen" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>.
    </p>

    <p>I made this website using Ruby's Middleman, because I am familiar with
    Ruby on Rails. It is very convenient to use helpers and loops in a website
    like this. I host it on GitHub pages, because it is free.</p>

  title: My Career Goals
  description: >
    <p>I like to work projects, where there is a beginning and end that I can
    keep in my mind. At school, I enjoy working through Computer Science
    homework, despite the pain of debugging, because I experience a feeling of
    accomplishment I cannot get from finishing a set of math problems. Because
    of this, I have been thinking about careers in consulting, real estate, and
    technology.</p>
